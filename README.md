# CO-DOCS
gathering the information of all medical youth that maybe just college pass out, or having any experience in medical. as we know, the corona is spreading very fast, we need more staff of medical to handle it, and it may be possibility that our present doctors and staff will be in shortage, so this is the app where every medical student (who have done any course in medical field) can register and volunteer. there are very big numbers of talented youth, which can contribute in handling corona, they can be trained in 2-3 days for testing of corona, and giving vaccinations. and then we can make teams of those volunteers for further handling of corona spread. from this our talented doctors may get some time on actually discovering or inventing the antidote of corona. so to save time of talented scientist and to utilize the young talent of medical, all this can be possible.
